So what we're going to do now is we're going to take two springs joined by two masses. Here we have the squares are a fixed center. We're going to fix that center and then allow these to move. And now we're going to lay one over the other like this. So we'll really have two spring mass systems, but they'll start off and the only difference will be one millionth in their initial velocity. One millionth. So tiny, tiny difference. So let's take a look at that system. So here it is and I'll start it now and we'll see that the red is the outer mass and the green is the inner mass. And there are two systems right on top of each other. Just a tiny, tiny difference. Now the first thing to notice is that these are pretty weird orbits, very difficult to predict. And now we'll see that the masses start moving apart. Now what this means is that a tiny, tiny difference in initial conditions ends up making a very large difference in their paths. And this is the definition of a chaotic system. One that essentially is unpredictable beyond a certain period. There is a certain time for which it's predictable and then after that it's not. So it's just like the weather. And the question is, are the systems that we're dealing with today, are they chaotic?
