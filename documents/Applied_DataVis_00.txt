Hi, welcome to Applied Data Visualization. Dr. Sanchez and I spent many years in MIT's Auto-ID lab, where our goal was to surface the data so that we could visualize what was happening in supply chains. We used to talk about, we want to know the four W's. What are we seeing? When have we seen it? Where have we seen it? And most important, why are we seeing it there? Now we'll be querying large data and Abel will be covering SQL queries so that we can filter out the data that we need. Often we'll need to combine multiple data sources, blending them together for example. And we'll need to enrich the data. And I'll be covering spatial data. Abel and I are in the MIT Geospatial Lab, so this is something close to our hearts. We spent many years struggling with geospatial data. It presents challenges that are unique. But with today's tooling, it's much, much easier. I'll be covering some of the cloud tools, things like Data Studio, now called Looker. And we'll be looking at GeoVis and also at Google's Earth Engine. Now often we'll need to combine fields. So for example, we may have latitude and longitude in separate fields that we need to combine because Google Maps is expecting them in a single field. So there are some details that you'll need to understand. But in general, the tools today are quite amazing. We'll be able to create apps, for example, and interactive dashboards that we can hand off to others so that they can explore the data for themselves. This field actually covers computer science, statistics, and also visualization, so designing these dashboards. It's not easy to get a great visualization. We'll be ending up looking at satellite data, which is quite massive. It's petabytes large. And Google's Earth Engine will give us a taste of how easy it can be to look at this massive data using today's cloud-based tools. So enjoy data visualization and applying it to real business problems. Bye for now. We'll see you online soon.
