So in this exercise I want you to pick up UFO data and I want you to tell me what day of the week has the most sightings. Is it a Monday or a Tuesday or whatever day? So look through and you'll have to count up for each day how many sightings there were on all the Mondays and then all the Tuesdays etc. So once you've found out what day of the week has most sightings then I want you to find out what time of day on that particular day of the week has the most sightings. So is it eight o'clock? Is it nine o'clock? So again you're going to have to loop through all the sightings of let's suppose the most popular day is a Monday on the Monday is it eight o'clock in the morning? Is it eight o'clock at night? Plot out a histogram that shows me what time of day has the most sightings and then do it for the second most common day of the week that has the second most sightings. Okay so here's the starter code for you. You pick up the UFO data and we're passing the time so that it gets plotted out like this and you'll see that there are some not a numbers here so colors aren't reported too well but I don't think you need them in this exercise. However you will need to focus on the time and be able to understand what day of the week is that ISO time that we're being shown here. Okay good luck hope you enjoy it have fun with the aliens bye for now
