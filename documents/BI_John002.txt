Hi, my name is John Williams. I'm Professor of Information Engineering here at MIT, and along with Dr Abel Sanchez, it's been our pleasure to produce a number of courses including these on visualization for business intelligence. Now business intelligence is the process of analyzing data to produce actionable information so that executives can make decisions that will improve company performance and drive new revenue streams. Business intelligence covers all areas of a corporation, for example, health monitoring of airframes, supply chain optimization, business development, product development, sales, and even cybersecurity. Business intelligence involves data mining, predictive analysis, text mining, statistical analysis, and even big data analytics. And today, they're often in the cloud. The goal, as I've said, is to drive profitability, optimize internal processes, discover new business revenue, identify business trends, and even business problems. It involves the four W's, what, where, when, and when we do business analysis, we want to know why these things have happened and what we can do to improve next. In this course, we'll be using desktop tools and also cloud-based tools. On desktop, we'll be covering Tableau, Excel, for example, and then in the cloud, we're going to focus on Google's tools, which include BigQuery and Looker. The modern tooling is amazing. Very soon, we're going to see AI built into these tools. It's coming fast, and we've had tremendous fun, and we hope you'll join us in these courses and produce astounding graphics that tell compelling stories. So see you online in the course. Bye for now.
