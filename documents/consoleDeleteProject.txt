So here we are in Google Cloud. Let's go to our console. Let's select a project now to delete. So here we have a number of projects that I've already created. So here I went to this button. And now it shows us the projects. I click on this one and to delete it I just go up here. And it'll ask me to type in the name of the project that I want to delete. DemoTest001. So let's shut it down. And the project is now shut down. And it'll all be deleted November 25th. So now we don't have that project in our list. So that's deleting a project. OK, bye for now.
