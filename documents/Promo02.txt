Hi, my name is John Williams. I'm a professor of information engineering here at MIT. And along with Abel Sanchez, it's been my pleasure to contribute to this course in data engineering. To a large extent, this course is an outgrowth of our work at the Auto ID Lab. This is where the Internet of Things was invented. And for the first time, we saw that items could be tracked across the globe by using technology. Both Abel and I were involved in architecting the EPC global network. And today we're seeing that almost all companies now are leveraging data to run their operations. So data is needed for decision making and all aspects of a corporation need up-to-date data. From sales and marketing to human resources to finance and product development, all of these have data pipelines that are giving them the data they need to make decisions and to run smoothly. There's over 20 billion connected devices. Every year over a trillion packages are sent around the world. So this is an important area. It's a hands-on course and we believe it's going to give you the skill set you need to have a career in data engineering. Abel and I program almost every day. We love this area. We think it's important and we hope that you find it exciting too. So we'll see you online in data engineering. Bye for now.
