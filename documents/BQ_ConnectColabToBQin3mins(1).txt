So, here I am in Google Cloud with BigQuery and I've got a dataset called Shakespeare and a table called Shakespeare that has about 100,000 lines. So in the ELT process, I've done the extract and load and now I need to transform this. I need to clean it and transform the data so that I can do business intelligence on it, say. So, I'd like to use a tool that I'm familiar with and that's Python and Python Pandas. So, I'd like ideally to have a notebook, say, and be able to access this in BigQuery. Now, I'm going to show you how to do that with a Colab notebook. So here we are in Colab. We can get a new notebook and we need to authenticate ourselves from the notebook to BigQuery. Now to do that, we need to put in these two lines from Google Colab, import auth and auth authenticate user and we should print out maybe that we're authenticated afterwards. Okay. Now, in BigQuery, we need to make sure that we have the BigQuery API. If you haven't got the BigQuery API attached, you need to go here to the search for BigQuery API and enable it. I've already got it enabled. So let's authenticate ourselves. Yes, we want to allow it. So it's asking us to choose an account. So this is the account that we have with BigQuery. So I choose that. And now it's saying it needs access, which I'm going to allow. And it's going to authenticate us. And now we're authenticated. I'm going to add these lines. So now we're going to use BigQuery. We're going to create a project. So I need to give it my project name. So that's my, you'd need to replace it with your project name. And I'm going to go with the verbose mode and I'm going to create a data frame. This is going to be a pandas data frame. And into that, I'm going to put the number of lines and I'm going to put it as the total rows. So there's going to be a column called total rows that we can then access through the data frame. I'm going to add another line while that's still working. And what I want to do is print out the data frame and total rows. So that query is run. And now let's run this. And we see we've loaded 116,000 rows and now we have it in this data frame, df. So just to show you the type of this data frame, let's put in type for df. So we run it and we'll see that it's a pandas data frame. So now we can apply all the knowledge that we have to transform this file and complete our extract, load and transform. Okay. So that's connecting up Colab to BigQuery.
