Hi, my name is John Williams. I'm a professor of information engineering here at MIT. And like all professors, I've had to write papers, so I've written over 250 papers and published a couple of books and have some patents as well. But my passion is software. I love writing software. It's challenging, but it's so rewarding too. Along with Dr Abel Sanchez, we've developed this course on data engineering. It's a product of our work at the AutoID Lab, where we invented the Internet of Things, and we saw that tracking over a trillion items a year moving through supply chains is challenging. Developing a global network to handle data is extremely challenging. And today, our goal is to analyze all this data in real time. So corporations are going through this digital transformation, and it's increasing by orders of magnitude the data that they have access to, but then they need to turn that data into actionable information. And that's the role of these engineering pipelines. So we're going to focus in this course on developing data engineering pipelines. We're going to look at what they consist of. We're going to look at the challenges, and we're going to look at some of the exciting developments as well. It's a hands-on course. Abel Sanchez and I program almost every day. We love programming. We think it's important. We think you get a different insight when you program to say, reading about something. That it's an art as well as a science, and you'll see that in the cases that we talk about. So we think you're going to enjoy this. We hope it makes it as passionate as we are about software, and we think it's a great career. We really recommend it to you, and we hope to see you online in this course. Bye for now.
