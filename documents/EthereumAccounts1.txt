OK, so let's go to MyEtherWallet. This part, MyEtherWallet, there it is. And this comes up. We'll click on New Wallet and it says that it needs to have a password. Let's make up a password. Download. OK. Download the Keystore file. Let's download that. OK. I need to save my private key. So I'm going to copy it and let me paste it into Notepad. So here's Notepad. Here's my private key. And I can save my address. And I'm going to save it in MetaMask. I need to connect to MetaMask. So here's MetaMask. I already loaded. And I've got a number of accounts. Let me just check how many I've got. OK, I've got six. And now I want to import a new account. So let's go here. Import account. Private key. Paste that in. And import it. So now I've got account 7. And we'll take a quick look how these accounts are stored in Ethereum. They're not actually in the blockchain but in the data structure that sits alongside the blockchain. So we'll come back now and take a look at that.
