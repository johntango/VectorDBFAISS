So, in this exercise, I want you to destroy buttons when they're clicked on. We've spent some time figuring out how to know which button has been clicked on, so now it's your time to actually do something with that information. And now when I click on one of them, it goes away. And you'll see now I've got one, three and four left. Let me click on this one, which should be four. Yes, now I've got one and three left. Let me destroy one. I've done that, and I've finally got three, and I destroy three. So this is what I want you to do. That's the exercise. I think you'll need to use filter. I want you to keep state, so let me show you that now. So I want you to use useState, and to do the following, we'll let state and setState, and they'll be equal to useState with the initial setup. And so what I want is to put the numbers of the buttons in there. So that's going to be your initial state. Now every time you destroy the button in here, this is where you'll be able to destroy the button and you can update the state. So what you'll need to do is instead of alert in here, you'll need to put some code. So in here, code to update the state and remove destroyed button. So what you'll need to do is probably, the hint would be to filter out. We know this index here is the button that we need to destroy. So out of this, let's suppose it's two, then we need to end up with a state that looks like one comma, no two, but three and four. So the state will get updated and you'll need to setState to whatever the new state is. Okay, so and then of course it's going to be re-rendered and to make sure that it's re-rendered, we'll need to make this state. Okay, so that's copy this code. This is your starting configuration. You've got to work in here. You may have to change some things elsewhere, but you should be able to do it. Okay, so that's the exercise. Copy this code, start here and good luck. Bye for now.
