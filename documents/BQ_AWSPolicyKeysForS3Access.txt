So let's suppose we want to give BigQuery the capability to go and get files from our AWS S3 bucket. We need to create keys that BigQuery can present to AWS, giving BigQuery the rights to access the S3 bucket. So let's see how we set up those keys. So we're on AWS. Let's go to the IAM, Identity and Access Management. And I've got five users and I want to set up a new user so I can use the user's keys to give to Google Cloud. So those keys need to have S3 bucket access capabilities. Let's see how we do that. There are several ways, but one way is we can add a new user. Let's do that. So let's call this S3 access user and we're going to give this user access keys. So we need to click this one. We don't want the user to actually log into the console. We're going to use programmatic access. So next we need to look at the permissions. Now we can either add the user to a group, which we've seen how to do before, or we can attach policies directly. Let's go this route. Now the policy that we need, I happen to know is S3. So let's take a look at those that contain S3. And we see Amazon S3 full access. So I want to give this policy to the user that they'd have these rights. So we've got that. Add tags. Now we're OK. Let's review. So here let's create that user. And as we create the user, that user now has these access keys and we need to copy these keys. So we can copy that one and we can place it into here. So let's copied that and let's copy this. So control C and then control V. So now we've got those keys that we'll need when we go to Google. OK, so we close. This and now we have another user. If we look at users again. We'll see that we have. Here, S3 access user and hasn't used the keys yet. So that's generating the keys in AWS that we can now go to Google Cloud and set up a file transfer. OK.
