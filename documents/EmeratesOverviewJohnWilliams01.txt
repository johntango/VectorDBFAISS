Hi, my name is John Williams. I'm Professor of Information Engineering at MIT, and together with Great Learning and the Emirates Institute of Finance, we've developed this program in software engineering and cloud computing. It's designed to equip you with the skills to stay ahead in the technologies related to the financial sector. You'll work on industry relevant topics to gain a fundamental understanding of the core concepts. In addition to the case studies, the program will include practical exercises, project work, and mentorship from industry practitioners. The program curricula for EIF have been created to provide the skills, knowledge, and confidence to grow in the field of financial services. Bye for now. Bye.
