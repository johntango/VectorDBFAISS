So here we need to create an account on Amazon Web Services. So this is the main account here. I already have an account, so what we need to do actually is that I suggest we search on Google for AWS account sign up. And if you go to this website, then it will take you straight away to completing the sign up. So click on this. It should take you to this place. Now notice AWS accounts include 12 months of free tier access. They'll probably ask you for a credit card, but we won't incur any charges. We'll be using the free tier all the time. So fill this in. It's going to ask you for a few things and I suspect it will ask for a credit card. Fill that in, but as I say we're not going to use any actual money. At least we shouldn't. So that's signing up for an AWS account. Once you've got an AWS account, obviously you can go to it. AWS. So here we complete the sign in. OK, now it knows who I am, so I can go here. It knows my password, but it's going to ask me if I've got two step identification. I suggest you turn that on. And I've got a code that I enter from my phone. So my code is 060492. So once you complete the sign in, you'll see a screen like this. And if you click on services, you can choose any of these Amazon services. And so there's quite a blizzard of these and we'll explore just a few of them. OK, so that's signing up for Amazon and you can obviously find out your billing. For example, there's my billing dashboard that you can go to. And you can see your bill details. So let's just take a look. So you can see my charges last month was 32 cents. So not very much at all. OK, so that's signing up for Amazon Web Services and we'll use the free tier. OK.
