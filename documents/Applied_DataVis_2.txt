Hi, in this section we'll continue to explore Data Studio, but we'll also introduce you to some other tools that you may want to use for business intelligence. We'll continue with Data Studio to show you how to pick up multiple tables and blend them together. Normally, you do this with a SQL query and joins, but here we can use something fairly simple called blends. We'll be showing you how then to take that data and display it on bubble maps that leverages Google Maps. And we'll then move to some other tools that, for example, can take a Google Sheet and create an app out of it that allows you to show your colleagues that data, but also, if you give them permission, allows them to alter the data. We'll also show you how to build a website on GitHub. It's very easy, and you should understand that GitHub is one of the main tools that is used today to coordinate teams. We'll finally be looking at Google Earth Engine, which can take satellite data and is basically as easy as you choose the satellite or satellites that you want to use, you tell it what part of the Earth you want to display, and it does the rest. It can handle petabytes of data, and it is truly amazing. We'll also be using another tool called GeoVis to show you bike ride data in New York. So we think that there are a lot of tools out there. These are some of the ones that you should be aware of. OK, bye for now. Bye.
