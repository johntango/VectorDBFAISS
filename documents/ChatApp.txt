So we're going to use Firebase to build a messaging app that looks like this. So this is, I put two side by side here, they're different people and this one when it sends messages, we'll say "Hi" and this is the polar bear 85. Here, "Hello", post the message. This is me. I'm 35 and I'm saying "Hello" and we both see all the messages. We're using Firebase to do this and let's see if we can build it. Here's our empty database. Now let's go to this and we'll post a message. Let's post a message "Hello" and take a look at our database. And there's our message "Hello". Now the way I've set this up is that we get a random number for our user ID. And so I've been given the number 39. You'll get a different number. And let's just put another message in there, post message good. And now if we go back to the database, we'll see that hello has been written, overwritten, and we get the latest message. So we're communicating with the database and if you log into yours, you should get this behavior. And we'll update this in the next video. Okay.
