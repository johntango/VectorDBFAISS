So let's talk about the BigQuery ecosystem. We start with the raw data and we extract it using a connector and load it into BigQuery. In BigQuery it'll be loaded into a dataset and into a table. And that'll be running in memory and we can access it via the BigQuery API. So now we need to be able to transform it and we can use several tools. One is DBT and another is Colab Notebooks. With Colab we can authenticate ourselves to BigQuery and then we can use the BigQuery API to query the data tables. When we do that the tables are going to be spread out over a cluster of machines. Now we can decide how many machines that we want to run but that query will be executed in parallel, which means that we can handle petabyte-sized data files. Now once we've transformed the data we'll be putting it back into a BigQuery dataset and table. And once the data is clean we can either use it to build a machine learning model or we can send it to our favourite business intelligence tool such as Tableau or Data Studio. Now let's just talk a little bit more about... So let's just talk now about the BigQuery ecosystem. So we've got BigQuery but that actually has helpers and it has Dremel that will handle the optimisation of queries so it'll decide what tasks need to be executed and what order they need to be executed in. And we've also got the Borg Cluster Manager which will spin up machines for us and handle transferring the files across those machines. Now we'll incur charges now for compute while we're doing these queries on the data. But let's suppose now we've finished with our queries. The nice thing is now that BigQuery will write out our data tables to Colossus storage. Colossus storage is like a data lake, it's an object store. Some people call it blob storage. But it's very cheap and the data now is sitting if you like on disks and the charges are minimal. We don't have any compute charges. Now the structure of the files is called Capacitor and it's a combination of column store and row store and it optimises reads and writes to those files. So we can now reconstitute from Capacitor files back into datasets and tables very quickly. So while the data is static if you like in Colossus, our charges are minimal. But then when we want to query the data, the data is reconstituted, it's like rehydrating it, pouring water on it and the tables come from disk and now they're in memory again and ready to be queried. So that's the BigQuery ecosystem and it's very slick indeed. OK, bye for now.
