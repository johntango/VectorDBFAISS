OK, so what we're doing here is we had if I typed localhost 3081 or 381 slash, it'll come up with my lucky number is 5. Now there's a concept called routing and we have app.get and we put the root here. Now let's add another one. We're going to put slash color and this time we're going to say my lucky color is, I'm still going to have to use the number, but I'm going to say lucky color. So what this means is if I make a request to color 3081 slash color, now it says my lucky color is 5. It's executing a different function. OK, so that will get me my lucky number is 5 and this my lucky color is 9. So what's happening is now we can use different paths to execute different functions and we could go on with this so for example we might have something like the about and we might not bother with a random number. We might just send this site is about shipping. Whatever. OK, so let's save that and now we go back here. I need to kill that and reload it. Reload it now if we hit the website and say about. This site is about shipping. So we can execute many different functions using this concept of routing. Thank you.
