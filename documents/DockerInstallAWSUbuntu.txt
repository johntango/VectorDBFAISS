OK, so I've just booted an Ubuntu machine on AWS. So here it is, it's running. And let me upload the zip file from our directory. So here I've got a zip file, test0.zip. And let me just check that I've got the right one. So here I've got... let me take a look at the Docker Compose. And the Docker Compose looks like this. It must be version 2. And we're going to run test0.js. OK, so let me just make sure that I'm going to delete that zip. And I'm going to re-zip these. This one, Dockerfile and Docker Compose. And just send them to the zip. And now I just want to transfer that zip. So I want to do string copy. Let me just move this so you can see it. So I want to do string copy here. Test.zip up to Ubuntu. Now remember to put the colon squiggly slash dot on the end of the Ubuntu DNS name. OK, so the zip is up there. Let me go back now and I need to install unzip. But I've got it installed. So I unzip it. Yes. Yes. Yes, this is the second time I've done it so I've got these on my machine. So now I've got test0.js which is the node instructions to set up a server. I've got Dockerfile and Docker Compose. Now I need to get Docker onto this machine. So let me bring up my cheat sheet here. So first we need to install Yum. OK, so we're going to do sudo apt install yum. And let's do that. So we need to do... Let's just make sure we've got everything updated. And now install yum. OK, so we've got yum. Now we can do... To get Docker... Let me show you the web page that gives you the instructions for this. So here, if you go to this file... OK, so I'll just leave it for a moment so you can see that. Then we've got instructions for installing Docker. And the main one that we need to get... is sudo apt-get-install dockerio. OK, so here we go. OK. So we've got the newest version of Docker.io. And now what we need to do... is we need to check that Docker is running. So we've got Docker build... So Docker is running. Now we need to make sure we can... Sorry, we need to sudo docker-compose. We need to install docker-compose as well. So sudo apt-install-compose. OK, we've got docker-compose. Now we can do sudo docker-compose up. Oh, we didn't get package.json. OK, let me get that. So let's do a string copy. Sorry, I need to do it from here. So I want to go... instead of the zip, let me do... package.json. OK, and then go back to... let's just make sure... package.json. OK, we've got that up there. Now we can go and do sudo docker-compose up. OK, now we've got... it's running it on port 8081. Let's just check that we can hit port 8081. Let me... I need the machine name first. Let's just check... public IP is this one. Can I get the public IP? Sorry, you can't see that. Let me just show you. Yeah, I'm getting the public IP here of the machine. And let me plonk it in. Oops, let's do it in somewhere else. Let's do it here. And I want to hit 8081. Yep, and so here I put in this and... Yeah, it gets my lucky number. So that's installing a Docker container and running a simple web server.
